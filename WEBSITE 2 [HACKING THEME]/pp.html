        [ ABOUT THE CREATOR ]
Hey there, I'm Aayan from India.
I'm really passionate about ethical hacking and gaming.
You know, I've been exploring the fascinating world of ethical hacking,
And it's been an incredible journey so far.

[ ABOUT MY HACKING TOOL ]
One of the coolest things I've done is create a hacking tool that simplifies some aspects of hacking.
Now, before you jump to conclusions, let me clarify something important:
I believe in responsible hacking.
My tool is designed to assist and educate,
not to encourage any malicious activities.
It's like a learning aid for budding ethical hackers.

[ + ] MY GOAL
My dream is to make ethical hacking more accessible in India.
I want everyone to have the opportunity to learn about this field,
but with the emphasis on ethics and responsibility.
Hacking shouldn't be about causing harm or chaos.
It should be a skill used for good.
So, my mission is to empower individuals with knowledge
and skills so that they don't have to rely solely on tools.
Hacking, at its core,
is about understanding systems,
identifying vulnerabilities, and finding solutions.
My tool is just a stepping stone to help people grasp
these concepts and develop the skills they need.
I truly believe that with the right guidance
and a strong ethical foundation,
we can create a community of responsible hackers in India
who use their skills to enhance cybersecurity and protect
against threats. After all, knowledge is power,
and with great power comes great responsibility.
